# Square Movement Flutter App

## Overview
This is a simple Flutter application where a square moves left or right when tapped on the respective arrow icons. The square starts at the center of the screen and smoothly animates to the left or right edge when the arrows are tapped.

## Features
- The square starts in the center when the app initializes.
- Left and right arrow icons are shown beside the square to move it in respective directions.
- The square smoothly animates to the left or right end of the screen when tapped.
- Once at the edge, the corresponding arrow disappears.
- Uses `AnimatedPositioned` for smooth animations.
- Implements a system-based dark/light theme.

## Code Structure
- `main.dart`: Contains the core logic and UI.
- `SquareMovementScreen`: Stateful widget handling movement logic.
- `_moveSquare()`: Moves the square to the left or right edge.

## Technologies Used
- Flutter
- Dart

## How It Works
- The `AnimatedPositioned` widget smoothly transitions the square when the left or right arrow is tapped.
- `GestureDetector` is used to detect taps on the arrows.
- `_position` variable determines the squareâ€™s position dynamically based on screen width.
- `_isAnimating` ensures smooth animations without interruptions.
